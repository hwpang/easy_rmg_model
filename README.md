# Easy RMG Model

This depository is to provide some useful tools developed during Xiaorui's pursuing his PhD degree on Chemical Engineering (combustion chemistry). The majority of the scripts are based on the [RMG](https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-Py) and [ARC](https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/ARC) package developed by [Green group, MIT](http://greengroup.mit.edu/).

## Setup

To set up this depository, you need to install [ARC environment](https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/ARC/blob/master/environment.yml) by `Anaconda` or `Miniconda`. Besides, you also need to add this package into your PYTHONPATH. For example, if the depository is cloned to your home directory `~/easy_rmg_model`, please append `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/easy_rmg_model`.

There is a `settings.py.example` inside `easy_rmg_model/easy_rmg_model`. Please make a copy of this file by `cp easy_rmg_model/easy_rmg_model/settings.py.example easy_rmg_model/easy_rmg_model/settings.py` and modify the resulting `settings.py` according to your settings.
